# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:
Pizza-Pierat is an app that will allow a user to signup/login through an online form or "Sign in using Google".
The user can then go through the steps of ordering a fairly customizable pizza.
The user can, at the creation of a pizza, edit the pizza's parameters or delete the pizza altoghether.
Upon accepting the final pizza the user is redirected to the history of their pizza orders with the most recent pizza added to the list.
